Description: SMS PDU encoding and decoding, including GSM-0338 character
 SMS PDU encoding and decoding, including GSM-0338 character set.
 .
 Overview
 --------
 .
 This library handles SMS-DELIVER and SMS-SUBMIT format PDUs, and includes
 full support for all data formats, flags and headers, and round-trips from
 PDU to object and back again.
 .
 It also includes convenience APIs for constructing new PDUs from text or
 data.
 .
 This library is very mature - it's been in production use for many years
 before the 1.0 release was made. It's also, as far as I'm aware, the most
 complete SMS PDU encoding and decoding library available.
 .
 The T39 functionality has been copied from the previous PyPI package with
 the same name as this library to provide some continuity. It is untested.
